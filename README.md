# Predicting-sale-prices-of-bulldozers-using-Machine-Learning
Machine learning model for predicting auction prices of bulldozers (It was posted on Kaggle). I made some EDA on the data and preprocessed it. I used the RandomForestRegressor
which from my point of view was the best , I did some tuning and it scored RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) = 2.46033 on validation data.
